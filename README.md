## About the Starting Grid
The Starting Grid is a CSS layout library based on the CSS Grid spec. It uses a very, very small subset of Grid features to provide responsve layouts. With just two classes on a parent container, you can lay out child elements into typical grid-style layouts. Beyond that, there's no extra markup to muck up your HTML.

## Install me
1. Clone this repository
2. `npm install`
3. `gulp` to compile scss to css, then `gulp watch` to run task automagically.

## Roadmap
* Uneven column splits (ex. 2 column, 60/40 layout)
* Responsive column classes
