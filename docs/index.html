    <h1>Grids by grid</h1>
    <p>The starting grid is a small CSS library to help build layouts quickly and easily. It is based on the new CSS Grid specification, which allows you to use minimal amounts of markup to create complex layouts. With just two classes on a parent container, you can lay out child elements into typical grid-style layouts. Beyond that, there's no extra markup to muck up your HTML.</p>
